        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Pomodoro Technique</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">The Pomodoro Technique is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that its creator, Francesco Cirillo, used during his university years. "Pomodoro" is the Italian word for "tomato."</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Francesco Cirillo developed this time management method in the late 1980s when he was a university student. He used a mechanical kitchen timer shaped like a tomato to break his work into focused intervals. These intervals, known as "Pomodoros," were typically 25 minutes long. After each Pomodoro, he would take a short break. This technique helped him improve his productivity and manage distractions effectively.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The name "Pomodoro Technique" stuck, and it has since become a popular productivity method used by many people around the world. The idea of using a tomato-shaped timer is symbolic of the simplicity and effectiveness of the technique, as well as its roots in Cirillo's personal experience.</p>
