# Pomodoro timer

This is a simple SvelteKit implementing a Pomodoro timer. The idea of the project is to create a simple app to demonstrate the usage of SvelteKit, implementing different pages, routers, server and client side, a login with a session cookie, custom themes and a call to an external API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173). You can view it in your browser.

### 4. Build and Serve (for Production)

To build the app for production and serve it:

```bash

The app will be built and served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173).
